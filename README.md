> Together we can make a lasting impact on a student's life and help them achieve their dreams.

At the Sujeeth Foundation, we help students network into their first job. Nearly half of college graduates struggle with job placement. The Sujeeth Foundation strives to help students practice agency by introducing the concepts of Grit by Angela Duckworth, Mindset by Carol Dweck, and Work Out Loud by John Stepper.

College is a place where experimentation thrives and opportunities to grow are abundant. We help students unlock the opportunity of education.

Together we make a lasting impact. [Subscribe](https://www.sujeeth.org/subscribe) to our newsletter to follow our journey.

## Our Sauce 
We nurture an environment that allows students to explore and develop their passion.

### Building a Brighter Future
We enhance students' educational journeys through the principles of "Grit," "Mindset," and "Work Out Loud." Our innovative approach facilitates a dynamic learning environment. Through specialized circles, we cultivate hands-on learning experiences, allowing students to actively engage with their education.

We believe in promoting a mindset of resilience, a determined work ethic, and the transparent sharing of knowledge. Empowering students with these principles, we help them network into their first job.

### What do we do? — Help students to transform their lives and find their career path
We provide a variety of services to support students in their academic journey, including,

- Resources: We offer students with resources that teach the basics of empowerment. By sharing Angela Duckworth's "Grit" Carol Dweck's "Mindset," and John Stepper's "Work Out Loud," we empower them with valuable skills for personal and academic growth, enriching their learning experience.
- Circles: We organize circles where students can apply their learned skills. Joining our "Work Out Loud" circles encourages students to turn theory into practice, improving communication, and collaboration, and applying essential concepts from the books.
- Partnerships: We partner with schools to socialize the concepts of Grit, Mindset, and Work Out Loud.
- Mentorship: We develop a mentorship network, where experienced mentors guide and support students in navigating their college experience.

### Why are we doing this? — Higher education can be expensive, but the benefits are worth it
We strongly believe that investing in students means investing in a better world. Through scholarships, training, and various services, we support college students. By helping students pursue their educational dreams, we're creating a brighter future—for both them and our communities. Together, we strive to build a fair and equal society where everyone can reach their fullest potential.
