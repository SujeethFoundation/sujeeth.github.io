Education can train our youth to undertake professions that can enrich their lives.  Today, education is broken:
- Only 34% of workers in the US are engaged. This means that most people are not happy with their jobs.  
- Student borrowers accumulated nearly $30,000 in undergraduate debt. This debt can be a burden for years after graduation.

It doesn't have to be this way:
- Teaching youth growth mindset unlocks the potential for development.  Failure is part of success and embracing failure helps people take risks that lead to change.
- Passion for what you do stems from learning what you do well and investing to develop your skills to solve a meaningful problem. 
- At their best, academic institutions are a place where experimentation thrives and opportunities to grow are abundant.
- The mindset of the student matters.

The Sujeeth Foundation provides scholarships to college students pursuing a STEM degree or graduate studies.  Scholarships are awarded based on Grit scores.  All applicants can take advantage of provided growth mindset training and other services.
