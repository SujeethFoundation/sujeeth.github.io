        <h5</h5>We recently lost a friend.  More importantly our friends lost a father and a husband.  In this post, I explore how the living try to continue the journey with love and compassion.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Jun 4, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/faith">faith</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a></span>

        <h5</h5>It's easy to get lost in a meme.  It's easy to respond to snark with sarcasm.  It's much harder to learn from those that disagree with you.  It's harder to listen with curiosity.  In this blog post I talk about how I use mental models to deconstruct labels into implied values.  By staying curious, by leveraging the Holy Spirit to listen, I think my life is more rewarding because I can search for God in others and turn them into my teachers.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Apr 16, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/faith">faith</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/parenting">parenting</a></span>

        <h5</h5>In Communion, I talk about my faith journey.  Specifically I try to answer: +Why I chose Catholicism when my wife was Episcopal and my mother was Hindu? +If I'm leading my children to be Catholic, why have I not gotten baptized? +How do I resolve my liberal beliefs around abortion and homosexuality with the Catechism of the Church?</li><li><span class="post-meta">Apr 11, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/legacy">legacy</a></span>

        <h5</h5>I've struggled with belonging since I was young.  The desire to belong has driven me for so long that I think it's a major part of my identify.  In this blog post, I talk about that desire nad how it's affected who I am right now.  I suspect, if I'm honest with myself, the desire to belong is underneath the anger and self-deprecation that exacerbates my depression.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Mar 25, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a></span>

        <h5</h5>I crossed a red line in my journey with depression this week.  I'm taking steps to get extra assistance.  I'm confident that the steps I'm taking will help me restore balance.  At the same token, I'm not simply trying to banish depression from my life as I have in the past.  I don't know what the answers are but I look forward to the next steps I take in establishing this new more complete identity.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Mar 18, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a></span>

        <h5</h5>When I was 17, I was committed to St. Louis University Hospital for 72 hours.  I'm retelling my struggle to own it.  It is part of me but it doesn't define who I am.  I think moments of struggle are also invitations to grow; and sometimes growth takes a long time.  As I'm writing this - I'm tempted to compare my struggle with those of others; there's a part of me that doesn't feel like I deserve to tell this story.  However as a good friend reminded me, comparison is the thief of happiness; struggle is struggle and grief is grief.  It's personal and isn't minimized because other grief or struggle exists.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Mar 12, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/heart">heart</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/integrity">integrity</a></span>

        <h5</h5>Over the last two weeks, I've been dealing with a depression flare-up.  Having been aware of depression for half my life, I understand how I experience the condition.  As a next step in this relationship, I'm sharing to exert ownership over this disease I live with.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Feb 19, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/faith">faith</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/parenting">parenting</a></span>

        <h5</h5>As a born Hindu and practicing Catholic, my faith journey has been complex.  It's a core part of who I am.  Likewise, it's a core part of how I'm trying to lead my family.  As the pandemic becomes less dangerous, I'm looking forward to rekindling the relationship with the local faith community.</li><li><span class="post-meta">Feb 11, 2022 --&nbsp; <a href="/categories/investing">investing</a>&nbsp; <a href="/categories/tech">tech</a></span>

        </h3>
        <h5</h5>I think I'll be able to hit my financial growth goals by keeping a smart weighting on equity, crypto, and real estate investments.  Ultimately, I think the proof will be in the pudding.  In the near term, I'm grateful that I'm able to do more work on the technological frontiers of our society.  If things do work out, I think I'll be able to self-fund some charitable giving aspirations that I have.</li></ul></div>
