In addition to providing funds, one of the goals of the foundation is to enrich the experience of every applicant.  To that end, welcome gifts, volunteering opportunities, community meetups and even the application for the scholarship itself – they are all targeted to help applicants build skills in Mindset, Grit, and Working Out Loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working Out Loud is a concept coined by John Stepper.  In today’s interconnected and fast-paced world, success is not solely determined by individual brilliance or expertise; it thrives on collaboration, community, and the power of networks. Enter “Work Out Loud” (WOL), a transformative approach that empowers professionals to harness the full potential of collaboration, share their work openly, and cultivate meaningful connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, WOL is a mindset and practice that encourages individuals to make their work visible, actively contribute to the success of others, and build purposeful networks. It is a departure from traditional silos and closed-door practices, ushering in a new era of transparency, generosity, and collective growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this digital age, where information flows freely and barriers to communication have diminished, the power of working out loud has become more evident than ever. By sharing our ideas, progress, and challenges with a wider audience, we tap into the collective intelligence of our networks and unlock opportunities for collaboration, feedback, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, WOL is not just about broadcasting our work; it’s about building relationships that transcend geographical boundaries and professional hierarchies. It’s about finding like-minded individuals, diverse perspectives, and unexpected collaborations that fuel innovation and drive personal and organizational growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John even created a guide to help people facilitate their own work out loud circles.  I envision where a community will build around the Sujeeth Foundation and we will be able to connect applicants to each other as they strive to determine their passion and achieve their purpose.  To help with that community building I’ve gathered John’s guides in this blog post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-1.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 1: Attune your attention&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
In your first week, after getting to know your other Circle members a bit better, each of you will pick your own individual goal. Then you’ll take a step towards that goal by creating a “relationship list,” an initial list of people related to your goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-2.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 2: Offer your first contributions&lt;/a&gt;
In Week 2, you’ll make simple contributions to people on your relationship list, deepening relationships in a small way. Just reviewing the list will further attune your attention to your goal, and the small steps you take each week will gradually increase your sense of empowerment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-3.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 3: Take three small steps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
In Week 3, you’ll make a simple adjustment to managing your time, you’ll add to your relationship list, and you’ll offer another kind of contribution. These small steps will help reinforce and expand your practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-4.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 4: Earn someone else’s attention&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
How you present your contribution can make all the difference. This week, you’ll practice refining the way you write your messages and how you approach people in general. These exercises will make your contributions feel more personal and valuable, and more likely to be effective.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-5.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 5: Make it personal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Most people think far too narrowly about what they have to offer. This week can change that for you. The exercises will help you understand how the broad set of things you may take for granted - what makes you you - can serve as the basis for meaningful connections with others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-6.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 6: Improve your visibility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
It’s hard for anyone to discover you and your work when you’re invisible. This week, to improve your chances of making connections, you’ll take a step towards improving your online presence. Then you’ll use your improved presence to deepen a relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-7.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 7: Be purposeful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This week, you’ll do one of the most powerful exercises in your Circle: “A letter from your future self.” By articulating a longer-term vision of what might be possible, you‘ll increase the chances of that vision becoming a reality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-8.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 8: Make it a habit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Although you’ve spent seven weeks thinking of your goal in terms of people and contributions, you’re still working on making it a habit and mindset. It’s natural, for example, to struggle with finding time to work your list or remembering to follow up. This week, you’ll explore ways to reinforce your new habit so it takes less effort and feels increasingly natural, and to overcome the inevitable challenges and setbacks. Then you’ll practice empathy (again) in a way that might surprise you - and will certainly distinguish you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-9.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 9: Explore more original contributions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
At this point in your Circle, you’re ready to further expand your range of contributions by making more of your work and thinking visible. Even if this is new to some of you or makes you uncomfortable, the exercises this week will help you take a step, allowing you to create something simple that’s also generous and useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-10.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 10: Become more systematic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Having a system can make things easier. This week, you’ll work with two simple systems, one for identifying new contributions and one for managing your relationship list. Then you’ll offer something which you may never have thought of as a contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-11.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 11: Imagine the possibilities&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
So far, the focus has been on your individual contributions and connections. In Week 11, you’ll expand your sense of what’s possible by thinking more broadly about your network, your role in it, and what you might accomplish together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-12.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 12: Reflect and celebrate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This final week marks the end of a process, and maybe a kind of beginning. You’ll reflect on what has changed for you and what might
come. In your last exercise, you’ll make several additional contributions, including some for yourself. Hold this final meeting over lunch or dinner if you can - or come up with some other creative way to create an environment that’s conducive to celebration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="announcements" /><summary type="html">The Sujeeth Foundation is committed to enriching the experience of every scholarship applicant by focusing on mindset, grit, and working out loud. We aim to facilitate community building among the applicants. To support this vision, I have gathered John Stepper&apos;s WOL guides, which provide a structured approach for individuals to implement the WOL practice. These guides span a twelve-week period and cover various aspects of building relationships, making contributions, refining communication, improving visibility, articulating a vision, developing habits, and expanding one&apos;s network.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Sujeeth Foundation starts today</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/announcements/Unlock-the-Opportunity-of-Education/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Sujeeth Foundation starts today" /><published>2023-05-16T01:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-16T01:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/announcements/Unlock-the-Opportunity-of-Education</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/announcements/Unlock-the-Opportunity-of-Education/">&lt;p&gt;This week I filed the paperwork to start the Sujeeth Foundation.  I want to use the foundation to unlock the opportunity of education.  Education can train our youth to undertake professions that can enrich their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, education is broken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only 34% of workers in the US are engaged. This means that most people are not happy with their jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Student borrowers accumulated nearly $30,000 in undergraduate debt. This debt can be a burden for years after graduation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teaching youth growth mindset unlocks the potential for development.  Failure is part of success and embracing failure helps people take risks that lead to change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passion for what you do stems from learning what you do well and investing to develop your skills to solve a meaningful problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At their best, academic institutions are a place where experimentation thrives and opportunities to grow are abundant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The mindset of the student matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sujeeth Foundation provides scholarships to college students pursuing a STEM degree or graduate studies.  Scholarships are awarded based on Grit scores.  All applicants can take advantage of provided growth mindset training and other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was raised in a family that believed in education.  I was told that if I studied hard, I would be recruited by employers and be ushered into a rewarding career.  The formula for success was simple - get good grades.  I ended up earning my B.A. in Economics from Saint Louis University in three frantic years.  During that time I also worked to support myself.  I didn’t sleep very much.  I also didn’t spend a significant amount of the time in the career center.  At the end of three years, I went to work at a call center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt that the promise was broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I realized that I missed the point.  People don’t hire you because of what you have done, they hire you because of what they think you can do.  I couldn’t say what I wanted to do.  I couldn’t explain how my skills were valuable.  I didn’t have a framework to launch a career from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I went back to school full time to earn my MBA from Washington University.  This time I was focused on entering consulting.  I had a clear picture that I needed to show that my accounting and analytic skills could contribute to a consulting team.  I eventually found a home at Microsoft that my valued my analytic skills, my technical propensity, and my sales experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a moment, the opportunity I received changed my stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This organization, this effort, is my attempt to pay forward the opportunity I was given.  I want to help people get jobs they love.  I think school is a great way to accomplish that if you keep the goal in focus.  That is why I filed the paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="announcements" /><summary type="html">This is the origin story of the Sujeeth Foundation.
