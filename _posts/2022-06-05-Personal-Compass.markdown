Recent announcements from the Catholic Church, like Archbishop Cordileone's decision not to admit Nancy Pelosi to Communion, has driven personal religious reflection.  I share many of Senator Pelosi's political leanings which leads me to wonder if there is room for me in the Catholic Church.  Ultimately, I've concluded that there is room because because as I present in [Communion](https://avisuj.github.io/wellness/catholic/Communion/) I think my personal beliefs are consistent with the Catechism.  This belief has been reinforced by conversations with the leader of my local parish.  

I've taken the moment of reflection to also calibrate my personal compass.  I'm using this post to consider how my beliefs are reflected and influenced by politics, religion, and science.  Broadly I believe:
- Politics is a social contract for the distribution of power.
- Religion is a faith based expression of morality. 
- Science is a way of exploring the truth.

Sometimes, my political beliefs like being pro-choice need to be reconciled with my religious beliefs like abortion is evil.  How I rationalize these conflicts leads to my personal compass.  Daniel Pink talks about the rationalization process in his analysis of moral regrets in the Power of Regret.  He says, "we have an instantaneous, visceral, emotional response about right or wrong — and then we use reason to justify that intuition."  

Understanding how my beliefs are different than others helps to explain my point of view.  As Daniel Pink relates, many of our moral differences occur "because one group has a narrower view of morality (don’t harm or cheat other people) and the other has a wider view (don’t harm or cheat other people—but also stay loyal to your group, heed authority, and uphold the sacred)."

By understanding my personal compass and that of others, I'm better able to accept feedback from others and learn from it.  In Thanks for the Feedback, Stone and Heen state that a common reason feedback is rejected is because it fires a truth trigger, a relationship trigger, or an identity trigger.  Understanding my moral compass helps me understand my triggers.  Understanding others moral compass can help me better understand context around provided feedback.

# Politics
Human beings are social creatures.  In "Why Leaders Eat Last" Simon Sinek states early in our existence we learned that we were more effective with outside dangers by working together.  Through specialization and cooperation, we were able to thrive and ultimately change our conditions to suite our needs, creating a world of surplus.  

As we went from groups 150 people, to city states, to nations - we needed to reach social compact on how power was distributed.  Our political systems distribute power across dimensions of representativeness and arbitrariness.  Our economic systems distribute resources across dimensions of control and centralization.

Living in the United States, I think a governments effectiveness can be measured by the degree that it empowers all of its constituents to pursue life, liberty and happiness.  Often times, I think that means a government must be able to balance the sometimes conflicted needs of constituents in a way that is perceived as just and fair.  I believe that that systems that distribute power through the rule of law tend to be more resilient over time.

# Religion
As an objectivist, I believe that moral truths exist.  I think living in alignment with these moral truths is living a Good Life. I think religion provides instruction around the moral truths and consequently makes it easier to live a Good Life.  As willing collaborators in God's plan, we gain freedom from sin through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.  Jesus calls us to love and in love we find our purpose.  

I also think that ia possible to live a Good Life by embracing a virtuous mindset regardless of faith.  For example, humanists are concerned with living a Good Life and will leverage the scientific method to reason what a Good Life looks like.

Ultimately, I choose Catholicism because the church's teachings make me a better person, a better father, and a better husband.

# Science
In his master class, Neil deGrasse Tyson describes the scientific method as "a problem solving approach that helps you glean reliable evidence in support of a hypothesis."  It allows scientists to test ideas in the effort to identify the truth.  Scientists share and repeat these tests until there is no need to keep doing so.  After a test is completed, it is published in terms dictated by the scientific method:
- observation
- questions
- hypothesis
- experiment
- result
- conclusion

This process allows for independent validation that ferrets out bias and mistakes.  I believe the truth discovered through the scientific method is useful like a landmark is to a person on voyage; it points to the right direction.  Therefore, I think it's important to reconcile what we learn through science with my political and religious beliefs as it helps ensure that I'm actually making progress to the Good Life.
