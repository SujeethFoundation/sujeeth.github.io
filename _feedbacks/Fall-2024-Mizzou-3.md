excerpt: One positive realization I came to at the end of our meeting is that if you never try, you will never know. It is better to try something new in a career or in life than regret it later on. This experience has been so rewarding and I gained many new friends as well as a wonderful mentor through this experience.

My experience with Kristin has been great! She was a wonderful mentor and so easy to talk to. She gave great advice and examples from her own career each week. She was always so kind and gave detailed responses to everything each week. One positive realization I came to at the end of our meeting is that if you never try, you will never know. It is better to try something new in a career or in life than regret it later on.
