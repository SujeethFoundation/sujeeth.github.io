Going into this experience, I was a bit unsure and didn’t know what to expect over the next eight weeks. However, my mentor provided us with valuable knowledge that I’ll carry with me. While our meetings at 1 p.m. on Mondays made my schedule a bit busier, they always left me feeling empowered because each lesson was meaningful. The skills and insights I gained prepared me for my professional life and gave me valuable tips for succeeding in interviews.

Initially, it was challenging to adapt, as these group sessions required vulnerability. We were encouraged to share personal experiences, which was difficult at first, but as the weeks passed, we all grew more comfortable. Our mentor was incredibly supportive, openly sharing her own experiences to help us learn. She genuinely wanted to provide us with advice that would be valuable to us as young professionals.

Our mentor took time to connect with each of us individually, greeting us on Zoom and making an effort to understand us on a personal level so she could give us the best guidance. By the end of these sessions, I learned a lot about how to present myself in interviews and act professionally in the workplace. I also realized the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone, as taking risks often leads to positive outcomes. I truly appreciated Tamara’s advice and could tell she cared deeply about our growth.
